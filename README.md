This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


 1. The question was clear enough to start, however I feel if there's any hint given about how to consume APIs it would have been perfect.

 2. Understanding - Spent around 40 to 60 minutes. Most time consuling were how to register app and configuring client id and client secret.

 Designing - It took 30 to 45 mintues.
 Coding - It took 8 - 10 hours
 Testing - Very basic testing is covered.

 3. Would like make the design responsive enough to render multiple device. Would think more about how to code the components more efficiently. 

 4. Yes. Once the users load more videos by clicking show more, the state array is growing. The search functionality would also get impacted I believe. 

 5. I have taken some consideration on rendering loading symbol if the API is slow, however somepoint the API was throwing 404, that needs to be handled properly. Right now, it would show a broken image with just an alt attribute.

 6. Would like to autoplay the next videos if the current video is on the verge of completion.
